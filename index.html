<h2>Welcome to this site</h2>

<p>This site shows must of my personal work. Most of them are paintings, some them are drawings, few of them are photogrhapys and very few of them are other things.</p>

<h3>Feel free</h3>

<p>To see around and probably see something you like. You can copy and paste wherever and whatever you want. You can buy or grab, or you can do it yourself.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this is site is updated with old work and new work, as it is mainly a way of keeping track of my art work.</p>

<h3>Please</h3>

<p>Take the time to watch and see, as so many images nowadays may distract us from what is around us. Normally I do what I do to keep moving toward something that might be better, or no.</p>

<p>Most of my work is done in my boring times, so I will keep trying to find a way for not calling it "work". Thank you.</p>
